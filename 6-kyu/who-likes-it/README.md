People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.</p><p>Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:</p><pre><code>[]                                --&gt;  "no one likes this"["Peter"]                         --&gt;  "Peter likes this"["Jacob", "Alex"]                 --&gt;  "Jacob and Alex like this"["Max", "John", "Mark"]           --&gt;  "Max, John and Mark like this"["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  --&gt;  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"</code></pre><p>Note: For 4 or more names, the number in <code>"and 2 others"</code> simply increases.</p>
